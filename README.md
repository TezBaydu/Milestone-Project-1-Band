## Introduction

*Council Culture* is a new fictional band about a group of musicians who are friends that grew up in London during the 1980's and 1990's.
The idea came to me as I too had grown up in London and influenced by various types of music and culture.
This band's genre is mainly punk rock but has shades of funk, groove and reggae.
There is potential for this kind of music to break the market and give the under-privileged a perspective, especially once the pandemic is over there may well be some controversial political decisions that could affect the vulnerable.

### Design

1.  The design was initally inspired by an image found on Pixabay of a ghettoblaster and once discussed with Graphic Designer (Terry Downs) who sent over images and logo ideas, it breathed the initial elements of the project. Based on some user stories I've decided to focus on the following pages: Home, Music, Events, Contact.
2. Pages not developed but potential to add: Merchandise, Videos, Gallery
3. Colour focus is mainly based on the band logo.
4. Imagery has associations to council estates, crime and considered poverty.
5. Band members have been given names associated to brands of Nike, this being the preferred trainer footwear at the time.
6. Band members have been given hats, glasses and certain colour shades to allow for mystique.
7. Home page is to draw the user and other pages to be more focussed on user requirements.
8. Pages to have a snippet of music for users to listen to and if wanting to download, these buttons are available also.

## Bugs and Issues

- Below Bootstrap link obtained from Bootstrapcdn but looks like an older version at 4.5.2 and so has been excluded
    "https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css"


- Media play buttons
    * Found a way of having a play button using HTML only, however this caused issues as was unable to toggle between play and pause and when there were several instances in one page music would overplay each other or would play and pause one song at a time, regardless of which button it was associated to.
        * After much searching I found a solution using JavaScript through the Github user "Ilker Yilmaz" "https://github.com/kuantal/Multiple-circular-player" and was able to use the scripts as shown on their gitpod to make a successful play pause action for songs. sizes and style adjusted to suit site.

- Index.html
    * list-inline header-download
        * needs page to reload for it to sit horizontally....? Even on responsive design checker - associated to list-inline-item style.css line 532: to work on.
            - done by adjusting css code on line 532.

- css code checker
    * Sorry! We found the following errors (2)
    * URI : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
        * 6	abbr[data-original-title], abbr[title]	Property text-decoration-skip-ink doesn't exist : none
        * 6	.accordion	Property overflow-anchor doesn't exist : none
    - This is the code asked to be copied from bootstrap but is showing errors on a couple of styles not encoded
        - Is a Bootstrap issue therefore no problem as long as it doesn't have an affect on the site.
            - done

    * Warnings
        * these extensions are recognised in browsers but not in validator
            * This issue is with bootstrap and is ok to be noted as does not affect website proficiency.
                - done
    
    * svg code for colourblindness not displayed as causes a row under footer.
        * by activating CSS display: none the row is removed visually, even though this did not impact on devices directly it was done this way to ensure assessments were not mis-directed.
            - Problem as this also removes the play button - Question for Mentor as adjustment isn't associated to CSS or HTML and directly affecting Browser as is part of colour blindness extension?
                - Solution: RGBlind Extension was automatically applying to css. Updated extension so it only activates when RGBlind button is pressed in browser.
                    - done

- Sticky Footer
    - Subsequent issue with sticky footer resolved via Bootstrap resolution.

- Fixed Images in Body
        - Fixed images in Body replaced after removing from separate div.
            - This had played havoc with images in foreground (events.html Room-2 jam jar) where wasn't mixing in blend mode for mobile and ipad devices.
        - Decided to apply separate Div to Contacts page for court-estate image and Events page for the glass-hole image and fill spaces to push images down to fill space.
