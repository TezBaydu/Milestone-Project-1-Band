## Introduction

*Council Culture* is a new fictional band about a group of musicians who are friends that grew up in London during the 1980's and 1990's.
The idea came to me as I too had grown up in London and influenced by various types of music and culture.
This band's genre is mainly punk rock but has shades of funk, groove and reggae.
There is potential for this kind of music to break the market and give the under-privileged a perspective, especially once the pandemic is over there may well be some controversial political decisions that could affect the vulnerable.

### UX

#### Aims

- Aimed at nostalgic punk rock audience, music producers and event organisers looking to hire bands.

- To give users a visual experience of what the bands music is portraying.
    * 80's & 90's style punk rock with shades of colour to help represent funk, groove and reggae.

- Easy navigation to musical tracks, events and contact page

- To be fully responsive to all screens and sizes

#### User stories

1.  This user is an events organiser looking for a punk rock band to be part of a group of bands for an event. They look for other events the band have performed and reviews they have had.

2. This user is in their early 50's who is a fan of punk rock looking for other music to listen to. The user is a fan and subscriber of many other groups and may want to know more of this bands progress in the future.

3. This user is a journalist working on a piece about new bands breaking the market. They are completely independent and will also look to give honest opinion of their music based on their own experiences of the band genre.

4. This user has no interest in punk rock music at all but is looking for imagery or influence for another project.

#### Design

1.  The design was initally inspired by an image found on Pixabay of a ghettoblaster and once discussed with Graphic Designer (Terry Downs) who sent over images and logo ideas, it breathed the initial elements of the project. Based on some user stories I've decided to focus on the following pages: Home, Events, Music, Contact.
2. Pages not developed but potential to add: Merchandise, Videos, Gallery
3. Colour focus is mainly based on the band logo.
4. Imagery has associations to council estates, crime and considered poverty.
5. Band members have been given names associated to brands of Nike, this being the preferred trainer footwear at the time.
6. Band members have been given hats, glasses and certain colour shades to allow for mystique.
7. Home page is to draw the user and other pages to be more focussed on user requirements.
8. Pages to have a snippet of music for users to listen to and if wanting to download, these buttons are available also.
9. Check codes for validation
10. Check site works on various browsers

### Questions for Mentor 
#### Meeting 1
- Have tested desktop and mobile version wireframes but do not have access to a tablet to appropriately test. Widths differ per product.
    * Is the width approprate for tablet?
    - When designing apply for each element to each device version - saves time in the long run - remember to use % sizes and padding as scope for device differences.
- Font sizes have been manipulated several times and opinion at the moment from users state satisfaction.
    * Based on experience are fonts appropriately sized?
    - They are readable and so are acceptable
- Figma has CSS guides for each elements
    * Can these be used to help design once HTML content has been placed?
    - Defenitiely not !
- 3 weeks to deadline
    * Considering other students deadlines, is this enough time?
    - On Average coding takes 2-3 weeks and so tight but on course
- Music page
    * Make album sizes the same size and shape - done
    * Apply Spotify and Apple aymbols under each album - this should be fine. - done
- Events page
    * Colour on payment icons and Titles - done
    * Bring quote down to separate - done
- Contacts page
    * Apply Submit button !! - done
- Start Coding
    * Book Mentor meeting when about 60% finished...

#### Meeting 2

- Nav background color has to be associated to 2 classes: .navbar-expand-lg and .bg-nav....
    * WHY ?!


### Bugs

- Media play buttons
    * Found a way of having a play button using HTML only, however this caused issues as was unable to toggle between play and pause and when there were several instances in one page music would overplay each other or would play and pause one song ata time, regardless of which button it was associated to.
        * After much searching I found a solution using Java through the Github user "kuantal/Multiple-circular-player" and was able to use the scripts as shown on thier gitpod to make a successful play pause action for songs.

- Index.html
    * list-inline header-download
        * needs page to reload for it to sit horizontally....? Even on responsive design checker

- css code checker
    * Sorry! We found the following errors (2)
    * URI : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
        * 6	abbr[data-original-title], abbr[title]	Property text-decoration-skip-ink doesn't exist : none
        * 6	.accordion	Property overflow-anchor doesn't exist : none
    - This is the code asked to be copied from bootstrap but is showing errors on a couple of styles not encoded...please advise

    * Warnings
        * these extensions are recognised in chrome but not in validator - please advise
    

### User Testing

- Align mobile contact image
    * done
- Make buttons slightly bigger for mobile, however still work when small (similar size as letters when typing)
    * Adjusted larger as design has carried on. - done.

### Code Testing

- HTML 

- CSS

- Java
    * Checked Javascript code against [Extends Class JavaScript validator](https://extendsclass.com/javascript-fiddle.html)
