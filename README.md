## Introduction

*Council Culture* is a new fictional band about a group of musicians who are friends that grew up in London during the 1980's and 1990's.
The idea came to me as I too had grown up in London and influenced by various types of music and culture.
This band's genre is mainly punk rock but has shades of funk, groove and reggae.
There is potential for this kind of music to break the market and give the under-privileged a perspective, especially once the pandemic is over there may well be some controversial political decisions that could affect the vulnerable.

This is the first project of a 4 module Full Stack Developer course provided by the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).
Main requirements are to show understanding of HTML and CSS by developing a User Centric Front End website.

## Bugs and Issues

- Bootstrap
    - Below Bootstrap link obtained from Bootstrapcdn but looks like an older version at 4.5.2 and so has been excluded
    "https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css"


- Media play buttons
    * Found a way of having a play button using HTML only. However this caused issues as was unable to toggle between play and pause and when there were several instances in one page music would overplay each other or would play and pause one song at a time.
        * After much searching I found a solution using JavaScript through the Github user "Ilker Yilmaz" "https://github.com/kuantal/Multiple-circular-player" and was able to use the scripts as shown on their gitpod to make a successful play pause action for songs. Sizes and style adjusted to suit site.

- CSS code checker
    - Bootstrap
        - Errors associated to Bootstrap
            - Property overflow-anchor doesn't exist : none
            - Property text-decoration-skip-ink doesn't exist : none
        - Does not affect website efficiency but to be considered if having issues with these particular property elements

- Fixed images in body element
    - Fixed backdrop images in Body replaced after removing from separate div.
        - This had played havoc with images in foreground (events.html Room-2 jam jar) where wasn't mixing in blend mode for mobile and ipad devices.
        - Decided to apply to separate Div to Contacts page for court-estate image and Events page for the glass-hole image and fill spaces to push images down to fill space.

## Deployment

### Gitpod to GitHub commits

To help with controlling versions you can commit to GitHub via Gitpod.
Once you are able to view the repository in Gitpod this is done by:

1. Access the control terminal
    - Usually found at bottom of project in "workspace" section.
2. Next to gitpod/workspace/(name of project)
    - Type "git add (and name of document you wish to commit to GitHub)".
    - If you want to find all that could be committed then you can type "git add ."
3. Type "git status"
    - This will help show what files have been modified, added or deleted for a pre-check prior to committing.
4. Type "git commit -m ("and then a brief description of latest updates in quotation marks")"
5. Type "git push"
6. Log into GitHub
    - Locate repository
    - You should be able to see the latest and history of commits in code section at top right of table of files list.
    ![git-commits](assets/readme-files/git-commits.jpg)



### Deploying via GitHub Pages

1. Log into GitHub and look for [https://github.com/TezBaydu/Milestone-Project-1-Band] or create an account.
2. Click on settings and ensure repository name is selected to Milestone-Project-1-Band.
3. Scroll down to GitHub Pages section and ensure Branch is 'Master' and folder is 'root'.
4. Click save and wait for site to be published.
5. Click link in GitHub Pages section to view published site.

### Forking repository

Forking a repository in GitHub is used to make a copy of a repository which you do not have rights access to. Once you have forked a repository you will be able to make changes without affecting the original. It can also be used to suggest changes of an original project and/or propose a project as starting point.

Steps on Forking a repository:
1. Log into GitHub and look for [https://github.com/TezBaydu/Milestone-Project-1-Band] or create an account.
2. At the top right hand corner of the page select "Fork".
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository to work with on your account without affecting the original.

### Cloning a repository

Cloning a repository in GitHub allows you to make a copy of your own repository which will affect the original repository.
If you wish to make changes which do not affect the original then this should be forked.

Steps to Clone a repository
1. Log into GitHub and look for [https://github.com/TezBaydu/Milestone-Project-1-Band] or create an account.
2. Ensure "Code" has been selected in menu.
3. Select code on top right of table.
4. Select either HTTPS, SSH or CLI.
5. You can either download ZIP for static files and utilise in GitHub or open with GitHub desktop.
6. If opening with GitHub Desktop then select. If not downloaded this will need to be to utilise benefits.
7. Once opened with GitHub Desktop select "File".
8. Select "Clone repository".
9. Select GitHub and the name of the GitHub repository. (URL can also be selected and the URL applied)
10. Select repository from the sources.
11. Click "Choose".
12. Click "Clone".

For further help and info you can select [Cloning and Forking repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)
