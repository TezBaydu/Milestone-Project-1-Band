# Project Council Culture

## Code Institute Milestone Project 1

[Council Culture](../images/cc-3.jpeg)

*Council Culture* is a new fictional band about a group of musicians who are friends that grew up in South London through the 80's and 90's.
The idea came to me as I too had grown up in London and influenced by various types of music and culture.
This band's genre is mainly punk rock but has shades of funk, groove and reggae.
There is potential for this kind of music to break the market and give the under-privileged a perspective, especially once the pandemic is over there may well be some controversial political decisions that could affect the vulnerable.

## UX

### Aims

- Aimed at nostalgic punk rock audience, music producers and events organisers looking to hire bands.

- To give users a visual experience of what the bands music is portraying.
    * 80's & 90's style punk rock with shades of colour to help represent funk, groove and reggae.

- Easy navigation to musical tracks, events and contact page

- To be fully responsive to all screens and sizes

### User stories

1.  This user is an events organiser looking for a punk rock band to be part of a group of bands for a weekend event. They look for other events the band have performed and reviews they have had.

2. This user is in their early 50's who is a fan of punk rock looking for other music to listen to. The user is a fan and subscriber of many other groups and may well look to know more of this bands progress in the future.

3. This user is a journalist working on a piece about new bands breaking the market. They are completely independent and will also look to give honest opinion of their music based on their own experiences of the band genre.

4. This user has no interest in punk rock music at all but is looking for imagery or influence for another project.

### Design

1.  The design was initally inspired by an image found on Pixably of a ghettoblaster and once discussed with Graphic Designer (Terry Downs) who sent over images and logo ideas, it breathed the initial elements of the project. Based on some user stories I've decided to focus on the following pages: Home, Events, Music, Contact.
2. Pages not developed but potential to add: Merchandise, Videos, Gallery
